# Brotli Decoding Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
After implementing improved headers to bypass Cloudflare, we encountered a new error:
```
400, message='Can not decode content-encoding: brotli (br). Please install `Brotli`'
```

## Root Cause
- The GMGN API server responded with **Brotli-compressed** data
- `aiohttp` requires the `Brotli` library to decode this compression format
- The library was not installed in the environment

## Solution Applied

### 1. Installed Brotli Library ✅
```bash
pip3 install Brotli
```

### 2. Added to requirements.txt ✅
```
Brotli
```

### 3. Fixed NoneType Error ✅
When GMGN API fails, `get_token_info()` returns `None`. The webhook handler was trying to call `.get()` on `None`, causing crashes.

**Fixed in `bot/utils/monitor.py`:**
```python
token_info = await get_token_info(token.get("mint", None))

# Check if token_info is valid
if not token_info:
    logger.error(f"Failed to get token info for mint: {token.get('mint')}")
    return
```

This was added in two places:
- Line 153-158 (PUMP_FUN swaps)
- Line 182-187 (Regular swaps)

## Status

✅ **Brotli decoding error: FIXED**  
✅ **NoneType crash: FIXED**  
✅ **Graceful error handling: IMPLEMENTED**

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **If GMGN API succeeds:** Bot processes swaps normally
2. **If GMGN API fails:** Bot logs clear error message and continues running (no crash)
3. **Compression:** Brotli-compressed responses are now decoded automatically

## Next Deploy

After deploying these changes:
1. Restart the bot
2. Monitor logs for successful API calls
3. If 403/400 errors persist, implement one of the advanced solutions from `GMGN_API_ISSUE.md`

## Notes

The improvements from the previous commit (better headers, retry logic, connection pooling) are now **fully functional** because Brotli compression is handled correctly.
